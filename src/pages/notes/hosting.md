A website needs a place to store files, images, code, and databases. Hosting is the service that stores these files on a server and delivers them to visitors through the internet.

<h3 class="header-branding">Core Idea</h3>

You rent space on a server. When users type your domain, the server sends your website to their browser.

<h3 class="header-branding">Main Hosting Types</h3>

**1. Shared Hosting:**
Many websites share one server. Cheap and basic.

**2. VPS Hosting:**
Virtual Private Server. More power and better performance.

**3. Dedicated Hosting:**
You get an entire physical server.

**4. Cloud Hosting:**
Runs on distributed servers. Auto-scaling. Used by AWS, GCP, Azure.

**5. Static Hosting:**
For static sites. Examples: GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, Cloudflare Pages.

<h3 class="header-branding">What Hosting Provides</h3>

Hosting provides:

- Storage for your files
- A public IP address
- A web server program
- Bandwidth
- Security updates

<h3 class="header-branding">How Hosting Connects to Your Domain</h3>

You point DNS records to your hosting server IP using A or AAAA records. When visitors type your domain, DNS finds your hosting server and the server sends back your site.

<h3 class="header-branding">What Is a Web Server</h3>

A web server is software that listens for HTTP requests and sends back responses like HTML, CSS, JS, images, or API output.

**Examples of web servers:**

- Nginx
- Apache
- Caddy
- IIS
- Node.js based servers
- Python servers like Gunicorn or Uvicorn

**What a web server does:**

- Listens on port 80 (HTTP) or 443 (HTTPS)
- Accepts HTTP or HTTPS requests
- Finds the correct file or application
- Sends the response
- Logs activity

<h3 class="header-branding">Static vs Dynamic Content</h3>

**Static content:**
HTML files, images, CSS, JavaScript files served directly.

**Dynamic content:**
Pages generated by code like Node.js, Python, PHP, or Ruby.

<h3 class="header-branding">Web Server Plus Hosting</h3>

Your hosting environment runs a web server.
Your domain points to that server.
Visitors hit your server.
Your server sends back web pages.

<h3 class="header-branding">Conclusion</h3>

Hosting provides the infrastructure to store and serve your website. A web server is the software that handles requests and delivers content. Together with DNS, hosting makes your website accessible to the world through a domain name.
