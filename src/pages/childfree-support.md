    <p>
      As we navigate through life, the importance of community and social connection becomes ever more vital for our mental and emotional well-being. The <strong>Childfree Couples Support Group</strong> is a future initiative designed to bring together couples who have chosen a life without children.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our goal is to create a vibrant, supportive network where we can share experiences, celebrate our choices, and ensure that we age with dignity, joy, and a strong circle of friends.
