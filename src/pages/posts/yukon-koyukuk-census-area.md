Venturing into the Yukon-Koyukuk Census Area means heading into the true wild of the Alaskan Arctic.

## Highlights of the Trip

### The Arctic
- **Arctic Circle Sign**: Standing at latitude 66°33′N. It's a bucket-list moment to officially cross into the Arctic Circle and receive a certificate of achievement. The drive up the Dalton Highway offers rugged views of the trans-Alaska pipeline and the boreal forest.
