title: 2025 Year in Review | Gratitude, Growth, and Next Steps
---

As 2025 comes to a close, I find myself sitting with a profound sense of gratitude. It’s been a year of immense learning, some hard truths, and ultimately, a clearer vision for what comes next.

### Gratitude and Reflection

First and foremost, I am incredibly grateful for this year. Despite its ups and downs, 2025 has been a teacher. It taught me resilience, it showed me the value of patience, and it highlighted the importance of simply showing up—even when things aren't perfect. I’m thankful for the moments of joy, the challenges that forced me to grow, and the simple fact that I’m here, ready to take on another year.

Looking back, 2025 feels like a transition year. It wasn't just about achieving goals, it was about understanding *why* I was pursuing them in the first place.

### My Rock and Partner in Crime

None of this journey would be possible without my spouse. We are celebrating **8 years of marriage**—eight years of growing up together, figuring life out, and supporting each other through every twist and turn.

She is more than just a partner, she is my greatest support system and my best friend. Whether we are exploring new cuisines (yes, she’s a total foodie!) or planning our next travel adventure, life is simply better with her by my side. Having someone who witnesses your life, who understands your quirks, and who pushes you to be better is a rare gift, and I am endlessly grateful for it.

### Four Years in the USA

In a couple of months, it will be four years of living in the USA. These past few years have been a masterclass in perspective. Living away from India, my home, has taught me independence in a way I never understood before.



It has given me the opportunity to travel, to explore landscapes I’d only seen in movies, and to learn how things work in a completely different part of the world. It’s widened my lens on life, teaching me that there isn't just one "right" way to live. Every culture, every system, and every person has something to teach if you’re willing to listen.

### The Changing Nature of Relationships

One of the more bittersweet realizations I’ve had this year is about the people in my life. I’ve noticed a subtle but distinct shift: close friends are becoming acquaintances. There is a growing imbalance where I offer a window into my life, hoping for connection, while others are content to just watch from the outside.

It’s a strange feeling to watch circles expand in number but perhaps contract in depth. Life gets busy, priorities shift, and we all drift into our own lanes. While it’s natural, it’s also a reminder to cherish the deep connections that remain and to be intentional about who I invest my energy in. It’s not necessarily a bad thing—just a different season of life where boundaries become clearer and time becomes the most precious currency.

### The Path Not Taken

On a more personal and vulnerable note, this year has forced me to confront the pain of certain life aspirations not coming to fruition. It’s a topic often swept under the rug, but the silence doesn't make the feelings any less real.

For a long time, there was a question mark hanging over this part of our lives. But this year, I’ve started to move from questioning to accepting. It’s a journey of grief, yes, but also one of redefining what truly matters. Accepting that this might be our path allows us to stop waiting for a future that might not happen and start fully embracing the life we *do* have right now. It is about finding peace in the "what is" rather than the "what if."

### Living with AI

AI has cut through everything this year. Work, creativity, even how we think. It’s a double-edged sword, bringing both incredible efficiency and a quiet anxiety about our own relevance. But ignoring it isn't an option. The challenge now is to learn the art of delegation: defining what is best left to algorithms and what requires the human touch. It's not about being replaced, it's about partnership. We need to embrace it as a tool, not neglect it as a fad, because the future belongs to those who can effectively collaborate with it.

Beyond its immediate impact, this year has also brought a stark realization about the environmental footprint of AI. The immense computational power required for training and operating these models consumes significant energy and resources. As we integrate AI more deeply into our lives, it becomes imperative to address this challenge. We must actively seek and develop more energy-efficient algorithms, sustainable data centers, and responsible hardware lifecycles to ensure that our technological progress doesn't come at an irreversible cost to our planet. It's about finding a better way to innovate, one that harmonizes with our environmental responsibilities.

### Health

I’ll be honest—I discarded my health and fitness this year. It’s easy to let it slide when other things take center stage, but I’ve felt the toll it takes. The energy dips, the lack of focus, the feeling of not being fully "in" my body.

Acknowledging this is the first step. I’m not beating myself up about it, but I am marking it as a critical area for change. Getting back into fitness isn't just about vanity or numbers on a scale, it’s about reclaiming the vitality and discipline that fuels everything else. That is a non-negotiable priority for me moving forward.

### Mistakes and the Path Forward

Mistakes were made. Plenty of them. By me, by others, by all of us. But dwelling on them serves no one. What matters is the clarity they have provided.

I feel clearer now than I have in a long time about the path for next year. The missteps of 2025 and previous years have acted as guardrails, guiding me back to what truly matters. I know what I need to focus on, what I need to let go of, and where I want to steer this ship.

### From Talk to Action

If there is one victory I am claiming this year, it is the shift from "talking" to "doing." For too long, I’ve been a planner, a dreamer, a "one day I’ll do this" kind of person.

But this year, I started. This blog you are reading? It’s proof. I stopped waiting for the perfect time or the perfect words and just put myself out there. It’s a small step, but it represents a massive mindset shift. I am learning that imperfect action is infinitely better than perfect inaction. In 2026, I plan to double down on this—less planning, more shipping.

So, here’s to 2025—thank you for the lessons. And here’s to 2026—I’m ready for you.
