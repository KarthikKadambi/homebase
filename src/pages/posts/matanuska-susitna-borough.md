The Matanuska-Susitna Borough offers some of Alaska's most accessible and dramatic glacial scenery.

## Highlights of the Trip

### Glaciers
- **Matanuska Glacier**: A valley glacier that you can actually walk on. Exploring the blue ice features, crevasses, and moulins was a once-in-a-lifetime experience. The sheer scale of the ice is humbling.
