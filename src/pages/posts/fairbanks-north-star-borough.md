Fairbanks is the heart of Alaska's interior, a place where winter is embraced with enthusiasm and warmth. From soaking in hot springs to meeting Santa, it's a land of unique experiences.

### Highlights of the North Star Borough

#### Winter Activities
- **Chena Hot Springs**: Soaking in the natural mineral hot springs while surrounded by snow and ice. A truly magical experience, especially if you catch the aurora overhead.
- **Rod's Alaskan Guide Service**: An exhilarating dog sledding adventure through the snowy trails. Meeting the team of huskies and feeling their power and excitement was unforgettable.

#### Local Landmarks
- **Santa Claus House**: Located in North Pole, Alaska, this is where the magic of Christmas lives year-round. We met Santa, saw the reindeer, and soaked in the holiday spirit.
- **Arctic Circle Trading Post**: A quirky stop in Joy, Alaska, marking the gateway to the far north.
