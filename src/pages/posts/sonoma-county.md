Sonoma County is known for its wine, but it also holds a special place for art and nostalgia.

## Highlights of the Trip

### Santa Rosa
- **Charles M. Schulz Museum**: A heartwarming tribute to the creator of *Peanuts*. Seeing the original comic strips and learning about Schulz's life was a delight for any Snoopy fan.
