<p>So you have decided to lease your car and have an establised credit score. Let's explore in detail on what is car lease, understand its core concepts and how to get a best deal.</p>

<p>If you want to learn more on what is the difference between buying vs leasing, then please check this article: <a href="/posts/car-buy-vs-lease">Buy vs lease</a></p>

<h2 class="header-branding">🚘 What Is a Car Lease?</h2>

A car lease is essentially a long-term rental agreement usually 2 to 4 years where you pay to use a car rather than own it.
You’re paying for the car’s depreciation (the value it loses while you drive it) plus finance charges and fees.

At the end of the lease, you return the car, unless you choose to buy it out at its residual value.

<p>Leasing a car often feels confusing, especially when you see a quote full of terms like money factor, residual value, and cap cost. But once you understand what each number means, you can tell if you’re getting a good deal or overpaying for your lease.</p>

<h2 class="header-branding">🚗 MSRP: The Lease Starting Point</h2>

MSRP is the sticker price — the manufacturer’s suggested price for the car before any negotiation, dealer discounts, or incentives.
It’s mainly used for two key purposes in a lease:

| Role                               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1️⃣ Residual Value Calculation** | The **residual value** (what the car will be worth at lease end) is *always a percentage of MSRP* — not the negotiated price. <br>→ Example: If residual = 63% and MSRP = $32,665 → Residual = $20,579. |
| **2️⃣ Benchmark for Negotiation**  | Dealers start from MSRP but you negotiate down to the **selling price** (also called “agreed-upon value”). That lower number becomes the **basis for your cap cost**, which determines your payment.    |

<h2 class="header-branding">💰 Selling Price (a.k.a. Agreed-Upon Value)</h2>

The selling price in a car lease is the negotiated price of the car — just like when you buy one outright.
It’s what you and the dealer agree the car is worth before any taxes, fees, or reductions are applied.

<h2 class="header-branding">💵 Gross Capitalized Cost (Gross Cap Cost)</h2>

The Gross Capitalized Cost is the starting total amount the lease company uses before subtractting any down payment or credits.

Think of it as:

“Everything you’re choosing to finance through the lease.”

It includes the negotiated vehicle price (selling price) plus any extra costs you decide to roll into the lease.

<h2 class="header-branding">🧮 Formula</h2>
Gross Cap Cost
=
Selling Price
+
Rolled-in Fees and Add-ons
Gross Cap Cost=Selling Price+Rolled-in Fees and Add-ons

<h2 class="header-branding">🧾 Then Comes the Adjustment</h2>

Once you subtract any Cap Cost Reductions (down payment, trade-in, or rebates), you get your Adjusted/Net Cap Cost — the number actually used in your lease math.

<h2 class="header-branding">🧾 Net (or Adjusted) Capitalized Cost</h2>

Net capitalized cost — also called adjusted cap cost — is the final amount you’re financing in your lease after all additions and reductions.

It’s basically the "loan amount" for a lease.

| Step | Calculation                                                 | Meaning                                   |
| ---- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| 1️⃣  | **MSRP – Dealer Discount = Selling Price**                  | You negotiate this part.                  |
| 2️⃣  | **Selling Price + Rolled-In Fees/Add-Ons = Gross Cap Cost** | This is what you’re choosing to finance.  |
| 3️⃣  | **Gross Cap Cost – Cap Cost Reduction = Net Cap Cost**      | Final amount used for lease calculations. |


<h2 class="header-branding">1️⃣ DMV / License Fees</h2>

What it is:
These are government registration fees for your car — not dealer markups.
They cover:

Vehicle registration

Title transfer

License plates

Local county fees (sometimes emissions or tire fees in California)

Typical cost (CA example): $400–$700 depending on the car’s value.

When paid:

Usually part of your drive-off amount (paid upfront).

But you can choose to roll it into the lease (then you pay interest on it).

In your quote: $473 — totally normal for Fremont, CA.

<h2 class="header-branding">2️⃣ Total Upfront Fees</h2>

What it is:
All the miscellaneous small charges that are paid at signing (not financed).
Examples:

Doc fee (dealer paperwork charge)

First month’s payment (sometimes)

Tire/battery fee

Electronic filing fee

Tax on upfront items

In your quote: $126.75 — likely covers doc + tire fees.
These are one-time and don’t affect your monthly payment if you pay them upfront.

<h2 class="header-branding">3️⃣ Capped Fees (Capitalized Fees)</h2>

What it is:
Fees that you choose to “capitalize” (roll in) — meaning they get added to your gross cap cost and financed over the term.

Common examples:

Bank acquisition fee (often $650–$995)

Dealer service fees

Any optional protection add-ons (if rolled in)

In your quote: $650 — that’s very likely the bank acquisition fee (mandatory from the lender, not negotiable).

| Fee Type                           | What It Covers                                 | Typical Amount | How It’s Paid         | Impact on Lease                   |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | -------------- | --------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **DMV / License Fees**             | Vehicle registration, title transfer, plates   | $400–$700      | Usually upfront       | No interest if paid upfront       |
| **Total Upfront Fees**             | Doc, tire, and small admin fees                | $100–$300      | Paid upfront          | No effect on cap cost             |
| **Capped Fees (Capitalized Fees)** | Bank acquisition fee or rolled-in dealer costs | $650–$995      | Rolled into the lease | Raises monthly payment (financed) |


<h2 class="header-branding">Understanding the Extra Fees</h2>

Disposition Fee – charged when you return the car, typically $300–$500.

GAP Insurance – protects you if the car is totaled and the payout doesn’t cover the remaining lease.

Maintenance Plan – optional but can save money on scheduled services.
