<p>So you have decided to lease your car and have an establised credit score. Let's explore in detail on what is car lease, understand its core concepts and how to get a best deal.</p>

<p>If you want to learn more on what is the difference between buying vs leasing, then please check this article: <a href="/posts/car-buy-vs-lease">Buy vs lease</a></p>

<h2 class="header-branding">üöò What Is a Car Lease?</h2>

A car lease is essentially a long-term rental agreement usually 2 to 4 years where you pay to use a car rather than own it.
You‚Äôre paying for the car‚Äôs depreciation (the value it loses while you drive it) plus finance charges and fees.

At the end of the lease, you return the car, unless you choose to buy it out at its residual value.

<p>Leasing a car often feels confusing, especially when you see a quote full of terms like money factor, residual value, and cap cost. But once you understand what each number means, you can tell if you‚Äôre getting a good deal or overpaying for your lease.</p>

<h2 class="header-branding">üöó MSRP: The Lease Starting Point</h2>

MSRP is the sticker price ‚Äî the manufacturer‚Äôs suggested price for the car before any negotiation, dealer discounts, or incentives.
It‚Äôs mainly used for two key purposes in a lease:

| Role                               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1Ô∏è‚É£ Residual Value Calculation** | The **residual value** (what the car will be worth at lease end) is *always a percentage of MSRP* ‚Äî not the negotiated price. <br>‚Üí Example: If residual = 63% and MSRP = $32,665 ‚Üí Residual = $20,579. |
| **2Ô∏è‚É£ Benchmark for Negotiation**  | Dealers start from MSRP but you negotiate down to the **selling price** (also called ‚Äúagreed-upon value‚Äù). That lower number becomes the **basis for your cap cost**, which determines your payment.    |

<h2 class="header-branding">üí∞ Selling Price (a.k.a. Agreed-Upon Value)</h2>

The selling price in a car lease is the negotiated price of the car ‚Äî just like when you buy one outright.
It‚Äôs what you and the dealer agree the car is worth before any taxes, fees, or reductions are applied.

<h2 class="header-branding">üíµ Gross Capitalized Cost (Gross Cap Cost)</h2>

The Gross Capitalized Cost is the starting total amount the lease company uses before subtractting any down payment or credits.

Think of it as:

‚ÄúEverything you‚Äôre choosing to finance through the lease.‚Äù

It includes the negotiated vehicle price (selling price) plus any extra costs you decide to roll into the lease.

<h2 class="header-branding">üßæ Cap cost reductions</h2>

Once you subtract any Cap Cost Reductions (down payment, trade-in, or rebates), you get your Adjusted/Net Cap Cost ‚Äî the number actually used in your lease math.

<h2 class="header-branding">üßæ Net (or Adjusted) Capitalized Cost</h2>

Net capitalized cost ‚Äî also called adjusted cap cost ‚Äî is the final amount you‚Äôre financing in your lease after all additions and reductions.

It‚Äôs basically the "loan amount" for a lease.

<h2 class="header-branding">Net cap cost summary</h2>

| Step | Calculation                                                 | Meaning                                   |
| ---- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| 1Ô∏è‚É£  | **MSRP ‚Äì Dealer Discount = Selling Price**                  | You negotiate this part.                  |
| 2Ô∏è‚É£  | **Selling Price + Rolled-In Fees/Add-Ons = Gross Cap Cost** | This is what you‚Äôre choosing to finance.  |
| 3Ô∏è‚É£  | **Gross Cap Cost ‚Äì Cap Cost Reduction = Net Cap Cost**      | Final amount used for lease calculations. |

<p>Lets talk about fees</p>

<h2 class="header-branding">DMV / License Fees</h2>

These are government registration fees for your car ‚Äî not dealer markups. They cover:

* Vehicle registration

* Title transfer

* License plates

Local county fees (sometimes emissions or tire fees in California)

Typical cost (CA example): $400‚Äì$700 depending on the car‚Äôs value.

When paid:

* Usually part of your drive-off amount (paid upfront).

* But you can choose to roll it into the lease (then you pay interest on it).

<h2 class="header-branding">Total Upfront Fees</h2>

All the miscellaneous small charges that are paid at signing (not financed).

Examples:

* Doc fee (dealer paperwork charge)

* Tire/battery fee

* Electronic filing fee

* Tax on upfront items

<h2 class="header-branding">Capped Fees (Capitalized Fees)</h2>

Fees that you choose to ‚Äúcapitalize‚Äù (roll in) ‚Äî meaning they get added to your gross cap cost and financed over the term.

Common examples:

* Bank acquisition fee (often $650‚Äì$995)

* Dealer service fees

* Any optional protection add-ons (if rolled in)

<h2 class="header-branding">Fees summary</h2>

| Fee Type                           | What It Covers                                 | Typical Amount | How It‚Äôs Paid         | Impact on Lease                   |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | -------------- | --------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **DMV / License Fees**             | Vehicle registration, title transfer, plates   | $400‚Äì$700      | Usually upfront       | No interest if paid upfront       |
| **Total Upfront Fees**             | Doc, tire, and small admin fees                | $100‚Äì$300      | Paid upfront          | No effect on cap cost             |
| **Capped Fees (Capitalized Fees)** | Bank acquisition fee or rolled-in dealer costs | $650‚Äì$995      | Rolled into the lease | Raises monthly payment (financed) |

<p>Disposition Fee ‚Äì charged when you return the car, typically $300‚Äì$500.</p>
