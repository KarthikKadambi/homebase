    <h2 class="header-branding">Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
      The <strong>Karthik and Neha Kadambi Foundation</strong> is a future initiative dedicated to funding and supporting underprivileged children who possess a burning passion for fields outside of traditional academics.
    </p>
    <p>
      We believe that talent knows no boundaries, but opportunity often does. Our goal is to bridge that gap for children who dream of expressing themselves through <strong>dance, music, and other creative arts</strong> but lack the financial resources to pursue formal training and education in these fields.
    </p>

  <section aria-label="Vision">
    <h2 class="header-branding">Our Vision</h2>
    <p>
      We envision a world where every child, regardless of their background, has the chance to explore their unique talents. By providing scholarships, grants, and mentorship, we aim to nurture the artists, musicians, and performers of tomorrow.
