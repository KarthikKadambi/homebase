  <p>
    With 13.5 years in software development, I love the craft of building websites that are not just functional‚Äîbut smart, fast, and beautiful. From static sites and JAMstack solutions to full-stack web apps, I care deeply about performance, accessibility, and user experience.
  </p>

  <h2>What I Do</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Frontend Wizardry:</strong> 11ty, React, Next.js, Astro, and mastering the latest CSS (CUBE, Sass, CSS-in-JS)</li>
    <li><strong>Backend Know-how:</strong> Node.js, APIs, deployment pipelines</li>
    <li><strong>Design Systems:</strong> UI/UX, accessibility, scalable CSS architecture</li>
    <li><strong>Web Security:</strong> Security headers (CSP, Permissions-Policy, HSTS), Cloudflare, SEO optimization</li>
    <li><strong>Performance:</strong> Asset optimization, build tooling, Lighthouse audits</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>My Philosophy</h2>
  <p>
    I believe great software is empathetic software‚Äîit respects users‚Äô time, device, and attention. My favorite challenge? Making the web delightful, even on slow connections and small screens. I‚Äôm also passionate about sharing knowledge (check out my <a href="/content/">blog</a>), mentoring, and never stopping learning.
  </p>

  <h2>Outside Work</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Traveling, planning road trips, and optimizing my personal finances for fun (and rewards!)</li>
  </ul>
