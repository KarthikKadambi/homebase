  About Me
Hi — I’m Karthik Kadambi (born 1990, Bengaluru)I’m a software craftsman with 13+ years of experience building web experiences that are fast, accessible, and beautiful.
My Journey
I grew up in Bengaluru, attending SVN, SVEC, and KLE schools for my early education. Later, I earned my Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science from SJBIT (2011). Over the years, I’ve worked with a range of clients—from startups like Kepran to enterprises like Accenture and Brillio.
What I Do
I build web solutions end‑to‑end:
*  Frontend Wizardry: 11ty, React, Next.js, Astro, modern CSS (CUBE, Sass, CSS-in-JS)
* Backend & APIs: Node.js, serverless pipelines, integrations
* Design Systems & UX: Scalable CSS architecture, accessibility-first, consistent UI
* Security & Performance: Security headers (CSP, HSTS, Permissions‑Policy), Cloudflare, Lighthouse audits, asset optimization, SEO
My Philosophy
Great software is empathetic software — it respects users’ time, bandwidth, devices, and attention. I aim to make the web delightful even on slow connections and small devices. I’m also passionate about mentoring, open source, blogging, and continuous learning.
Beyond Code
When I’m not writing software, you’ll find me:
* Traveling or planning road trips
* Geeking out over personal finance (optimizing for fun & rewards)
* Reading, learning, or tinkering with side projects
