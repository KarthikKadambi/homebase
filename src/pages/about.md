    <h3>Early childhood and education</h3>
    <p>Born in 1990, I began my academic journey at Saraswathi Vidya Nikethan, where I completed my early schooling. I continued at Sri Vani Education Centre until March 2005, which provided a strong academic foundation and encouraged holistic development. During my time there, I was also an active member of the National Cadet Corps (NCC) Air wing, which helped instill discipline, leadership, and a sense of civic responsibility.</p>
    <p>I then pursued my pre-university education at KLE, focusing on science, and completed it in May 2007. From 2007 to 2011, I attended SJBIT (S.J.B.
