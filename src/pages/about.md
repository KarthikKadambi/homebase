  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <h2>ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Karthik Kadambi</h2>
  <p>
    With 13+ years in software development, I love the craft of building websites that are not just functionalâ€”but smart, fast, and beautiful. From static sites and JAMstack solutions to full-stack web apps, I care deeply about performance, accessibility, and user experience.
  </p>
  <p>
    I started my career in customer support and fashion design (yes, really!). That unique journey sharpened my creativity and empathy, which I now channel into writing clean code and designing thoughtful, user-centric products.
  </p>

  <h2>What I Do</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Frontend Wizardry:</strong> 11ty, React, Next.js, Astro, and mastering the latest CSS (CUBE, Sass, CSS-in-JS)</li>
    <li><strong>Backend Know-how:</strong> Node.js, APIs, deployment pipelines</li>
    <li><strong>Design Systems:</strong> UI/UX, accessibility, scalable CSS architecture</li>
    <li><strong>Web Security:</strong> Security headers (CSP, Permissions-Policy, HSTS), Cloudflare, SEO optimization</li>
    <li><strong>Performance:</strong> Asset optimization, build tooling, Lighthouse audits</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>My Philosophy</h2>
  <p>
    I believe great software is empathetic softwareâ€”it respects usersâ€™ time, device, and attention. My favorite challenge? Making the web delightful, even on slow connections and small screens. Iâ€™m also passionate about sharing knowledge (check out my <a href="/content/">blog</a>), mentoring, and never stopping learning.
  </p>

  <h2>Outside Work</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Chasing the Northern Lights and photographing glaciers in Alaska</li>
    <li>Playing Carnatic music on my keyboard</li>
    <li>Building Marvel-inspired CSS animations</li>
    <li>Traveling, planning road trips, and optimizing my personal finances for fun (and rewards!)</li>
  </ul>
